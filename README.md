<h1>Inscribe</h1>

As a student in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, our final project is a MERN-stack CRUD app. I chose to make a writing program called Inscribe centered on individual text blocks that can be created within each title that's made. 

I used a combination of MongoDB with Mongoose-defined Schemas, Express, and Node.js to configure my back-end functionality and React for the front end. 

This was very interesting to work on. I was very impressed with how much functionality can be packed into the front-end with React to handle real-time changes without having to query the database. This project really stretched the limit of what I could accomplish in a week, but I'm delighted with what I've ended up with.

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
Thank you so much to Michael, Hayk, and Victor for being all the help you've given me in this course. I've grown so much in these past months and I've appreciated the opportunity to get to learn from you. Also, huge thanks to my group of classmates who kept me company while we coded together and let me talk out any issues I ran into. I hope to continue the friendships we've made long past the end of this course. This class wouldn't have been the same without you.

<h3>Plans for the future</h3>
In the short term, I'd like to add the ability to edit and delete titles and buttons to re-order the textblocks. In the long-term, I'd love to add an export function that would compile all the text blocks into a .txt or .pdf file for users to be able to save locally.
